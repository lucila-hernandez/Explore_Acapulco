                    <p class="card-text">La Quebrada is one of Acapulco’s most iconic attractions. Divers leap from heights of 40 feet (12 meters) and 80 feet (24 meters), timing their jumps to coincide with incoming waves. This precise calculation helps them avoid injury.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Often, the divers carry torches, adding a dramatic flair to their feats. Many of these divers are from families with a rich history of cliff diving. Although this tradition dates back many years, the La Quebrada Cliff Divers group was officially formed in 1934.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Witnessing these fearless divers against Acapulco’s stunning coastal backdrop is a thrilling and unforgettable experience.</p>
